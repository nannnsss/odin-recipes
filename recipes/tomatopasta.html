    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Adapted from <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015178-marcella-hazans-tomato-sauce">Marcella Hazan</a>.This is a wonderfully simple dish that is warming and delicious. There are only 4 ingredients and they come together to make a silky, delicate tomato sauce. Don't be scared of the butter.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul id="ingredients">
        <li>2 cups tomatoes, in addition to their juices (ie. 28-ounce can of San Marzano whole peeled tomatoes).</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 onion, peeled and cut in half</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine tomatoes in their juices, butter, and onion halves in a saucepan. Add a pinch or two of salt.</li>
        <li>Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, for about 45 minutes. Stir occasionally, mashing any large pieces of tomato with a spoon. Add salt as needed.</li>
        <li>Discard the onion before tossing the sauce with pasta. This recipe makes enough sauce for a pound of pasta.</li>
    </ol>
